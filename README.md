# Harvard-Master-s-Thesis-2018

This repository contains some work from my Computational Biology & Quantitative Genetics Master's thesis at Harvard University. 

## Project outline
The project outline can be found in thesis_proposal_mieling_final.pdf

## Data
The data used for this project was collected directly from SIDER Side Effect Resource (http://sideeffects.embl.de) and WITHDRAWN (http://cheminfo.charite.de/withdrawn/). 

## Data Exploration
Some of the data exploration efforts can be found in: drug_se.ipynb, drug_target_se_sider_DB_overlap.ipynb, integrate_databasets_2018_02_21.ipynb. 

Statistical analyses and further analysis can be found in: dendrograms_results_2018_04_21.m and meddraCpdSimilarity2018_03_31.m.
